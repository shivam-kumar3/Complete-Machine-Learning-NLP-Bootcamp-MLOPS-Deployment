    "   ### The MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared metrics are mainly used to evaluate the prediction error rates and model performance in regression analysis.\n",
    "* MAE (Mean absolute error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by averaged the absolute difference over the data set.\n",
    "* MSE (Mean Squared Error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by squared the average difference over the data set.\n",
    "* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the error rate by the square root of MSE.\n",
    "* R-squared (Coefficient of determination) represents the coefficient of how well the values fit compared to the original values. The value from 0 to 1 interpreted as percentages. The higher the value is, the better the model is."
