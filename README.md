# 🧠 My Complete Machine Learning & NLP Bootcamp Journey with MLOps & Deployment 🚀

Hi! This repository is a personal record of my learning journey through a comprehensive **Machine Learning + NLP Bootcamp**, including practical exposure to **MLOps** and **Deployment**.

I'm documenting everything I'm learning, building, and practicing — from core ML theory to end-to-end project deployment using tools like **Git**, **Docker**, and **MLflow**.

## 📍 What I'm Learning

### ✔️ Machine Learning & NLP Concepts
- Exploring both foundational and advanced topics in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
- Working on real-world datasets and projects to apply theoretical concepts in practice.

### ✔️ Math Behind ML
- Studying the core math that powers ML algorithms — including Linear Algebra, Probability, and key Statistical concepts.
- Understanding the inner workings of algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Descent.

### ✔️ Deep Learning Intuition
- Learning the concepts behind neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
- Getting familiar with CNNs and their role in computer vision tasks.

### ✔️ MLOps & Deployment
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub.
- Learning to containerize ML applications using Docker.
- Using MLflow to track experiments and manage model lifecycle.
- Planning to deploy models with tools like Streamlit and FastAPI.
